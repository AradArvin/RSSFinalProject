This is a Django **Rest Framework** Project and it features a website to parse xml files and return data as **API**. 
It uses django version 4.2.5 to bring all the new features into the code. I used all the knowledge I gained 
from Django to code a proper parser and provide an api. so Welcome to my rss feed parser project
