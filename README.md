## Installation Guide

Since this project uses the django project technology I recommend you to read this part to properly set up the project.

- first you need to fork this project to your own repo.


- clone the forked repo to you'r local storage >>>
    
    `git clone https://github.com/AradArvin/RSSFinalProject.git`


- make a virtual environment for the django project >>>
    
    `python3 -m venv .venv`


- activate the venv like this.

    `source .venv/bin/activate`


- now you can install the required packages using this method. in the root directory of the project:

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

this will automatically install all the tools and packages needed for the project, so the project could run.(Django will be installed as well)
